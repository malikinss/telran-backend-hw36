# Homework 36:

## Task Definition

Update code of LTR Evaluation from CW #36
Write additional function `__checkArithmeticExpr`
takes: expression
checks matching against defined regex. It is only syntax checking that includes placing parentheses, operands as any number (either integer or float), given operators (see CW + `**` as pow additional operator) with appropriate placing operands and operators checks pairing of parentheses ( and ) only. Regex may check placing parentheses but cannot check pairing. So `"(10 + 20))))"` is ok from syntax aspect but no pairing; `() + 10 (/) 20` - is ok from pairing aspect but no from syntax

Write addition tests for testing syntax and pairing parentheses
