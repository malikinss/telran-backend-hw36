    Test suite for left-to-right arithmetic expression evaluation.

    These tests validate that `LtrCalculator` correctly evaluates

    The calculator is expected to:
    - respect operator semantics as defined by the evaluation layer,
    - correctly handle nested parentheses,
    - fail fast on invalid syntax,
    - propagate runtime errors such as division by zero.
