    Evaluates arithmetic expressions strictly from left to right.

    This evaluator intentionally ignores operator precedence and does not
    support parentheses. It assumes that the input expression is already
    syntactically valid and consists only of numeric operands and supported
    binary operators.

    Responsibility:
    - orchestrate evaluation order,
    - delegate actual computation to OperatorRegistry.

    Non-responsibility:
    - syntax validation,
    - parentheses handling,
    - operator precedence resolution.
