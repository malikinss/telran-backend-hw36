    Registry of supported binary arithmetic operators.

    This class serves as a single source of truth for all binary operators
    supported by the evaluation layer. It maps operator symbols to their
    corresponding callable implementations and provides a uniform interface
    for operator lookup and execution.

    Responsibility:
    - define which operators are supported,
    - expose operator symbols for parsing,
    - delegate execution of binary operations.

    Non-responsibility:
    - expression parsing,
    - validation of operator placement,
    - handling of operator precedence.
